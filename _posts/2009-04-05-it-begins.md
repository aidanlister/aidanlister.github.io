I'm told I'm not a very funny person. Nor is my writing of particular quality. However, after camping this domain name for the last eight years I've finally decided to do something useful (perhaps debatable) with the space and start my own blog. My repository still lives at the <a title="usual address" href="http://aidanlister.com/repos/">usual address</a>, but I will be upgrading it shortly. Happy reading!
