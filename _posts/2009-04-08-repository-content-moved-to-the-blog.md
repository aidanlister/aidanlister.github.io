I have just finished moving all of my repository content to separate posts in WordPress. I also decided to get a little tricky and manually imported all of the old comments into WordPress too.

Moving the comments was fairly complicated as I didn't record a name or a website, which happens to be the two required fields for WordPress. Using some SQL magic I split the email into name@url, which has worked reasonably well.

I've still got lots and lots of cleaning up to do, so excuse the mess. Once it's all done, I will redirect all of the incoming repository links to their relevant blog post.

Also I should take this opportunity to heap praise on the WordPress team - guys, you have built an amazing piece of software, it's an absolute pleasure to use (as long as you don't look inside the codebase).
