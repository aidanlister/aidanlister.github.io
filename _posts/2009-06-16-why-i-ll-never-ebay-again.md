title: Why I'll never eBay again

I listed my old Macbook Pro 15" laptop for sale on eBay today. I paid my fees. I reviewed my add. I was happy for about 6 minutes, until I received the following barrage of emails:
<blockquote>-----------------------------------------------------------------
MC010 A26 TKO NOTICE:  Restored Account- aidanlister
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Hello aidanlister (aidanlister@gmail.com),

It appears that your account was accessed by an unauthorised third party to list items without your permission. At this time we have taken several steps to secure your eBay account. Be assured that your credit card and banking information is safe as this information is kept encrypted on a secure server and cannot be viewed by anyone.</blockquote>
Followed by:
<blockquote>-----------------------------------------------------------------
MC040 NOTICE: eBay Auction(s) Cancelled - User Agreement - Abusing eBay

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Hello aidanlister (aidanlister@gmail.com),

Due to the suspension of your account you are prohibited from using eBay in any way. This includes registering a new account.

Please note that this does not relieve you of your obligation to pay any fees you may owe to eBay.</blockquote>
Evidently listing an item for sale constitutes abuse, but it's nice to know they won't charge me for it.
<blockquote>----------------------------------------------------------------
MC045 aidanlister: Your eBay automatic payment request
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Hello aidanlister (aidanlister@gmail.com),

We have temporarily disabled your automatic payment method for 30 to 60 days. During this time, eBay will not attempt to collect automatic payment for your invoices.</blockquote>
Okay I thought, there's a lot of scammers in the world ... I'm sure they are just taking precautions. Great, I like precautions. I bet there's a way to clear all this up in My eBay and I'll chalk one up to the Nigerians.

Oh, how wrong I was. Not only has my password been changed, clicking on "Forgotten password" (and filling in my entire life history) sends me this beauty of an email:
<blockquote>-----------------------------------------------------------------
Forgotten Password
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Dear aidanlister,

This email was sent automatically by eBay in response to your request to recover your password. This is done for your protection; only you, the recipient of this email can take the next step in the password recover process.</blockquote>
Okay simple one-time login, this should be no problem then pow:

<a href="http://aidanlister.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/eBay.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-369" title="eBay - The ultimate user experience" src="http://aidanlister.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/eBay.png" alt="Please log in (with your password) to change your password" width="500" /></a>

You want me to SIGN IN WITH MY PASSWORD ... TO CHANGE MY PASSWORD? I mean, great odens raven guys, what the hell?

As I furiously write all of this in an anonymous customer support request (because I can't log in to my account) I ponder; for a company that spends literally millions every year on ensuring users feel safe on their website, if this is the best they can do, then good luck in the future because I'm done. I'll never eBay again.

What do people sell stuff on these days? I'd give craigslist a shot, but I'm worried my ad might be misconstrued sexually.

<strong>Update</strong>: 17th June 2009
I received the following email from eBay today:

<blockquote>
Thank you for writing to eBay's Customer Support. My name is Emma and I
will be assisting you with your account.

Please complete the following steps to secure your account:

1. Change the password on your personal email account. It's likely the
unauthorised person has access to your email account. By changing the
password, we can safely send you instructions and it will help prevent
your eBay account from being accessed by someone else again.

2. Please contact our Account Security Live Help team
</blockquote>

How ridiculous. Not only can I not log into my account, eBay are still under the impression that someone else listed the laptop for sale. I quite clearly stated in both the subject, and the first lines of my support request that this wasn't the case.
