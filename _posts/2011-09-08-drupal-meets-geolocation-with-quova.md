<a href="http://developer.quova.com">Quova</a> - the worlds largest geolocation provider - has sponsored the development of a suite of <a href="http://drupal.org">Drupal</a> modules to bring geolocation to Drupal.

With their <a href="http://drupal.org/project/quova">suite of modules</a> site developers can now easily create locale aware, geo-targeted compelling experiences in Drupal.

The suite of modules for both Drupal 6 and 7 includes:
<ul>
<li><em>Quova Core</em> - Provides an API to interact with the Quova IP Info service, and helpers for location based customizable content.</li>
<li><em>Quova Context</em> - Built in context support allows you to use country and line speed as a context argument. This allows you to easily display localised blocks, display country dependent blocks, or swap out bandwidth sensitive content.</li>
<li><em>Quova Locale</em> - Provides automatic language switching based on the users country and region.</li>
<li><em>Quova Weather</em> - Integrates with the Weather module to provide a block showing weather at the users current location.</li>
<li><em>Rules</em> - Built in rules support allows you to use country as a rules condition allowing location based site customizations or geofencing. Combined with <a href="http://drupal.org/project/commerce">Drupal Commerce</a>, this allows you to enable and disable payment processors depending on the users location.</li>
<li><em>Views / Location</em> - Built in helpers to allow you to interface easily with Views and the Location module. For example this can be used to automatically display branches closest to a potential customer.</li>
<li><em>Ad</em> - Allows geotargeting of advertising using Quova and the Ad module.</li>
</ul>
