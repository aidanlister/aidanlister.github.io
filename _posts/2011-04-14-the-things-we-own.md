title: The things we own
section: traveler
---
Only when we have lost everything are we free to have anything ...

Everything we own exerts a pressure on how we live our life. Some of these things are physical, a car, a house, a kitten - all of these preclude spontaneity. Cars need to be garaged, houses need their mortgage paid, kittens need to be looked after.

Similarly of our more meagre possessions. Nice clothes prevent us from rolling in the mud or splashing in the rain.

But what of it?

As I set here on my beautiful Macbook Pro I can't imagine life without fast access to the internet and all my documents at my fingertips.

Minimalism is not something we necessarily choose, but when it is thrust upon us we either accept, embrace and adapt - or we reject, struggle, and continue on as we always have.

Do we define ourselves, or do the things we own define us. Hardly a new theme, but the recidivism with which this theme reappears is only matched by its importance to those that adhere to its philosophy.
