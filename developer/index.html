        <p class="lead">I have been an active web developer since 1999. I am proficient with dozens of languages but specialise in Python and PHP, and in a few different frameworks, namely Drupal and Django. I also enjoy the odd task in MIPS, MATLAB, C, or VHDL when required. I am a strong proponent of open source, web standards, and accessibility.</p>
